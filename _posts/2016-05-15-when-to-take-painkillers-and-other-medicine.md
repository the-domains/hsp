## When to take painkillers and other medicine?

Medicine in general is a very useful thing, but in some cases taking it can be worse than not taking it. Here are my rules of thumb for HSPs

****

1. Regardless of the type of condition, if you are heading off to rest and have a pretty high degree of certainty that you won't be disturbed to be called upon to do active tasks during the time of the medication, take whatever you can take that will improve your quality of rest (painkillers, decongestants, sleeping tablets, etc)."Medicines are good, but good sleep is better" :-)
2. If you are dealing with a temporary and irregular condition that is unaffected by your behaviour while it goes away (eg. caffeine withdrawal) then take meds. You will be less grumpy and there is little downside.
3. If you are dealing with a one-off illness, then during periods when you will be called upon to perform to do active tasks to a level of competence (parenting, work, partnering) and that pushing yourself beyond a certain level of effort could worsen the illness, then
  1. try not to take stimulants or other medications that will blind you to the level of effort and stress you are subjecting your system to (eg. pseudoephedrine, codeine)
  2. take symptomatic medicines to reduce discomfort where possible (eg. vicks vapour rub)
  3. take intermediate medications (eg. panadeine, ibuprofen, aspirin) when you need to, in the knowledge that they may slow down the overall healing process slightly as you can push yourself a bit before tiring. This also applies for example to deep heat and muscle strains (and then using those muscles), medicated throat lozenges and sore throats (and then talking a lot), and so on.
4. If you are dealing with a chronic condition, then during periods when you will be called upon to perform to do active tasks to a level of competence (parenting, work, partnering)
  1. when pushing yourself beyond a certain level of effort will not affect the illness, then work out what works best in your life as a balance between any negative side-effects of the meds (eg. drowsiness, lack of mental clarity) and the pain relief and other benefits they might bring (eg. increased energy, improved mood, reduced sensitivity) and take that level and type of medications
  2. when pushing yourself beyond a certain level of effort could worsen the illness (eg. for the next day or following week), then as per \#3a and \#3b and find your balance with \#3c and use that amount (as per \#4a)
